# Vitamova

### About

This website is for learning Ukrainian. You can feel free to copy the code or run it on your own environment. For now, the application is available for free at https://vitamova.com 

## Compatability

We have only tested this application on RHEL. It will probably run on CentOS - no guarantees.

## Installation

Download the setup.sh file.
`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WKBSoft/vitamova/master/setup.sh -o setup.sh`

Then run the setup file. You must run it as someone in the sudoers group.
`sh setup.sh`

Move into the vitamova directory.
`cd vitamova`

Finally, run the run file.
`sh run.sh`

Now the server is running on port 80.
